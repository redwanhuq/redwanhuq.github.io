## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Red. I'm a data scientist in New York City.

Having always striven to use data and technology to maximize the impact of my work, I transitioned my career from a life scientist to a data scientist. This blog serves to chronicle my journey and the road ahead&mdash;sharing what I've learned, my experiences, and maybe a few side projects I'm working on.

## What have I done?
I currently work at [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en.html). I received a PhD in molecular physiology and biophysics from [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton) where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a [new](https://www.bcm.edu/news/molecular-physiology-and-biophysics/nanoparticle-therapy-for-autoimmune-disease) [treatment](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808) for autoimmune diseases. During grad school, I also founded and led a [501(c)(3) nonprofit organization](http://medcenterconsulting.com) that trains scientists and doctors to become management consultants, and also provides consulting services. Previously, I worked in [biotech](https://www.canon-biomedical.com) and [venture capital](http://fannininnovation.com).
