I figured I'd focus my first post on something generic and what better way than to discuss what this blog will revolve around: data science! Actually, when I talk to people about data science, I usually get blank stares, maybe a head nod or two, and if I'm lucky, someone will ask what it is. Because data science is an emerging field, practically everyone has their own definition, so allow me to share mine.
<!-- TEASER_END -->

Everything I've learned about data science has come from reading myriad blogs, white papers, and chatting with data scientists. From what I've gathered, *data science* is still a buzzword, popularized in the past five years by [Drew Conway's venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram). Since then a multitude of other venn diagrams have cropped up, [some more serious than others](http://joelgrus.com/2013/06/09/post-prism-data-science-venn-diagram), but they all shake hands on one thing: data science repurposes other fields, which include statistics, mathematics, computer science and artificial intelligence (AI), to solve problems and answer questions within a particular business domain such as finance, pharma, marketing, tech, etc. Perhaps that's why data scientists are referred to as [unicorns](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theopriestley/2015/07/01/chasing-big-data-and-the-data-scientist-unicorn/#2529a3693bdb)--finding someone with experience in more than a few of these areas is exceedingly challenging. Over the past few years however, the field shows signs of maturing with emergence of [numerous](https://www.thedataincubator.com) [bootcamps](http://insightdatascience.com), [online](https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science) [courses](https://www.udacity.com/courses/data-science), and some universities even offering [graduate degrees](https://datascience.berkeley.edu).

**My interpretation of data science is: the use of data to derive insights or develop a product that bolsters business value**. I know that sounds comically ambiguous but to put it into context, let's compare data science to *data analytics*.

Data analytics has existed for decades, popularized by the advent of Excel. Data analysts come in many flavors: marketing analyst, financial analyst, operations analyst, etc. However, they all utilize data to summarize *what* is happening in the company. Data analytics, which is synonymous with *business intelligence* when it focuses on historical data, is crucial for providing a descriptive picture of correlations or answering questions such as:

- How do our costs compare to our competitors? 
- What products or clients are our biggest winners/losers?
- How are our customers purchasing our products (online vs. brick and mortar)? 

On the other hand, data science takes the insight generated from data analytics one step further to a) figure out *why* something is happening, b) determine how to use this information for improved decision-making in the future (also known as *predictive analytics*), and/or c) develop a product or service. 

Since data science incorporates the word *science*, it typically involves the rigorous application of the [scientific method](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/science-of-biology/a/the-science-of-biology) to answer these questions. For example, data scientists may apply A/B testing to reveal the driving force behind trends. As true scientists (here's where they really begin to differ from analysts), they come up with their own questions to investigate, generate hypotheses, and identify how to acquire the data to test those hypotheses. Since real-world datasets are notoriously messy, data scientists spend the majority of their time cleaning or *munging* the data prior to performing an analysis. Finally and perhaps the most important aspect of data science is telling a story and providing an actionable recommendation; therefore, data scientists typically master building articulate presentations or visualizations (instead of publishing academic papers) to communicate their findings.

The second aspect of data science utilizes an algorithmic approach to make accurate predictions; its main tool is *machine learning*, which according to [Arthur Samuel](http://domino.research.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/600cc5649e2871db852568150060213c/3d602ed510e01ee985256bfa0067fb65!OpenDocument), "gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" and is a technique to achieve AI. **In a nutshell, instead of giving a machine a list of instructions to follow (known as a computer program), machine learning trains them like we teach our children or pets.** If you're thinking about Skynet or the Matrix, you've been watching too many sci-fi movies! Data scientists develop practical applications of AI to *automatically* detect fraud, understand how a customer segment "feels" about a product, forecast sales, optimize the value chain, determine a pricing strategy, accelerate the drug discovery process, etc. 

The final aspect of data science involves the development of data-driven, AI-based products. For example, many companies are supplementing their customer service systems with chat bots. Marketing teams use AI to understand and adapt to dynamic customer behaviors and preferences. Your email spam filter and phone's navigation system are built using machine learning. Netflix, Yelp and Pandora use AI to provide you with personalized recommendations. And while machines have been able to "see" and "hear" for ages, data science has empowered them to "think", "understand" and "adapt" as well, enabling [lifelike robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY&t=2s), digital assistants such as Siri, and the quest for driverless cars.

While I've made it seem like data science can be easily distinguished from data analytics, many companies use the two terms synoynmously; startups may have the same person wearing both hats. Moreover, some data scientists will work on all three aspects I've mentioned here, while others will have more focused roles. The take home is that currently, opinions on what exactly data science is vacillating. In fact, I don't even believe it's a new field of science per se; rather, I agree with [Jim Gray](https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Paradigm-Data-Intensive-Scientific-Discovery/dp/0982544200): **data science is the latest evolution of scientific thinking, following empirical, theoretical and computational**. Since this is the first blog post, I don't intend it to be exhaustive. I could dedicate a series of blog posts on machine learning or why data science couldn't have existed in any point in history until now, but I'll leave that for another day. 

Feel free to leave me your comments below. One of the best parts of data science is that there's always something new to learn, and I love talking about it.
