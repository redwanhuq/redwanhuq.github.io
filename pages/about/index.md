## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Red. I'm a machine learning engineer. And I love to build stuff.

Ever since I was a kid, I've adored programming, math, and tech. After spending over a decade as a life scientist, I decided to switch to a career that centers around my longtime passions&mdash;a data scientist&mdash;while still enabling me to leverage the analytical skills I've honed over the years. I soon found my niche in the ever-evolving data world: *developing products and pipelines that use machine learning.*

This blog originally served to chronicle my journey during the career transition, but I now use it to share fascinating stuff I've learned in machine learning engineering and software development with a few other curiosities throw in.

## What have I done?
I currently work at [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en.html) where I build data science tools, pipelines, and software. I received a PhD in molecular physiology and biophysics from [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton) where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a [new](https://www.bcm.edu/news/molecular-physiology-and-biophysics/nanoparticle-therapy-for-autoimmune-disease) [treatment](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808) for autoimmune diseases. During grad school, I also founded and led a [501(c)(3) nonprofit organization](http://medcenterconsulting.com) that trains scientists and doctors to become management consultants, and also provides consulting services. Previously, I worked in [biotech](https://www.canon-biomedical.com) and [venture capital](http://fannininnovation.com).
