## Who am I?
Hi, my name is Redwan, and I'm an aspiring data scientist and machine learning practitioner.

I believe data science and artificial intelligence are not only poised to improve our daily lives and transform businesses, but also usher in the next industrial revolution and solve mankind's toughest problems. Having held a lifelong fascination with answering questions with data, I recently decided it was time to stop being a spectator. I've since then dedicated myself to the goal of pursuing a career in data science and eventually contributing to the evolution of machine intelligence. 

This blog serves to chronicle my journey, sharing what I've learned and a few projects I'm working on.

## What have I done?
I recently received a PhD in molecular physiology and biophysics from [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton) where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a [new](https://www.bcm.edu/news/molecular-physiology-and-biophysics/nanoparticle-therapy-for-autoimmune-disease) [treatment](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808) for autoimmune diseases. During grad school, I also founded and led a [501(c)(3) nonprofit organization](http://medcenterconsulting.com) that trains scientists and doctors to become management consultants. Previously, I worked in biomedical [R&D](https://www.canon-biomedical.com) and [venture capital](http://fannininnovation.com).
