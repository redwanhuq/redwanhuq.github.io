I've long since held a fascination with artificial intelligence, and feel incredibly fortunate to witness this field evolve and flourish. I strongly believe AI is poised to not only dramatically improve our daily lives as consumers, but also transform business strategy and usher in the next industrial revolution. After taking courses in machine learning and learning about opportunities in data science, I decided to stop being a spectator and focus on turning my interests into a career.

My background includes training in the fields of immunology, nanomedicine and molecular diagnostics. I received my PhD from [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton) where I utilized carbon nanotechnology to develop a [new treatment](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808) for autoimmune diseases. As a graduate student, I also founded and led a Houston-based [501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation](http://medcenterconsulting.com) that trains PhDs and MDs to become management consultants. Throughout both endeavors, my favorite aspect has been generating meaningful insights from data to make more informed decisions.

I believe my hypothesis-driven and analytical approaches from 14+ years of experience in academia and industry, my business acumen and leadership skills from building a company, and my passion for answering questions with data and code will facilitate this transition. As I navigate this new adventure, I write this blog to share what I'm learning along the way and perhaps a few projects I'm working on.
