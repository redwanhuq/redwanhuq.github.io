## Who am I?
Hi, my name is Redwan, and I'm an aspiring data scientist and machine learning practitioner.

I'm trained as a life scientist but long since held a fascination with artificial intelligence, programming and answering questions with data. After taking courses in machine learning, I decided to stop being a spectator and pursue a career in data science. I write this blog to chronicle my journey, sharing what I've learned and a few projects I'm working on&mdash;hopefully it's useful for others making the transition as well.

## What have I done?
I recently received a PhD in molecular physiology from [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton) where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a [new](https://www.bcm.edu/news/molecular-physiology-and-biophysics/nanoparticle-therapy-for-autoimmune-disease) [treatment](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808) for autoimmune diseases. During grad school, I also founded and led a [nonprofit organization](http://medcenterconsulting.com) that trains scientists and doctors to become management consultants. Previously, I worked in biomedical [R&D](https://www.canon-biomedical.com) and [venture capital](http://fannininnovation.com).
