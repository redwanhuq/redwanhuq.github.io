### Who am I?
Hi, my name is Redwan and I'm an aspiring data scientist and machine learning practitioner.

### Why read this blog?
I'm trained as a life scientist but I've long since held a fascination with artificial intelligence and answering questions with data. After taking courses in machine learning, I decided to stop being a spectator and focus on transitioning into data science. As I navigate this new adventure, I write this blog to chronicle my journey and share what I've learned&mdash;perhaps even a few projects I'm working on.

### What have I done?
I just received a PhD in molecular physiology from Baylor College of Medicine where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a [new](https://www.bcm.edu/news/molecular-physiology-and-biophysics/nanoparticle-therapy-for-autoimmune-disease) [treatment](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808) for autoimmune diseases. During grad school, I also founded and led a [501(c)(3) nonprofit organization](http://medcenterconsulting.com) that trains PhDs and MDs to become management consultants. Before that, I worked in biomedical [R&D](https://www.canon-biomedical.com) and [venture capital](http://fannininnovation.com). Throughout all of these endeavors, my favorite aspect has been generating meaningful insights from data to make more informed decisions.
