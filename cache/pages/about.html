<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Red. I'm a data scientist that likes to build stuff.</p>
<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've adored programming, math, and tech. After spending over a decade as a life scientist, I decided to switch to a career that centers around my longtime passions&mdash;a data scientist&mdash;while still enabling me to leverage the analytical skills I've honed over the years. During this time, I found my niche in the ever-evolving data world: <em>developing automated, modular pipelines that use machine learning.</em></p>
<p>This blog originally served to chronicle my journey during the career transition but is now my outlet for sharing fascinating stuff I've learned in data science and software development with a few side projects throw in.</p>
<h2>What have I done?</h2>
<p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en.html">Nielsen</a>. I received a PhD in molecular physiology and biophysics from <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton">Baylor College of Medicine</a> where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/molecular-physiology-and-biophysics/nanoparticle-therapy-for-autoimmune-disease">new</a> <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808">treatment</a> for autoimmune diseases. During grad school, I also founded and led a <a href="http://medcenterconsulting.com">501(c)(3) nonprofit organization</a> that trains scientists and doctors to become management consultants, and also provides consulting services. Previously, I worked in <a href="https://www.canon-biomedical.com">biotech</a> and <a href="http://fannininnovation.com">venture capital</a>.</p>
