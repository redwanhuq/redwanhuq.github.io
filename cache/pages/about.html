<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Redwan, and I'm an aspiring data scientist and machine learning practitioner.</p>
<p>As a trained life scientist, I strive to use data and technology to maximize the social impact of my work. Witnessing AI and data science improve our daily lives and transform businesses, I believe they're also poised to usher in the next industrial revolution and address the biggest challenges facing humanity&mdash;it was time to quit being a spectator. I've since then dedicated myself to pursuing a career in data science and eventually contributing to the evolution of machine intelligence.</p>
<p>This blog serves to chronicle my journey&mdash;sharing what I've learned, my experiences, and a few projects I'm working on.</p>
<h2>What have I done?</h2>
<p>I recently received a PhD in molecular physiology and biophysics from <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton">Baylor College of Medicine</a> where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/molecular-physiology-and-biophysics/nanoparticle-therapy-for-autoimmune-disease">new</a> <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808">treatment</a> for autoimmune diseases. During grad school, I also founded and led a <a href="http://medcenterconsulting.com">501(c)(3) nonprofit organization</a> that trains scientists and doctors to become management consultants. Previously, I worked in biomedical <a href="https://www.canon-biomedical.com">R&amp;D</a> and <a href="http://fannininnovation.com">venture capital</a>.</p>
