<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Red. I'm a machine learning engineer in New York City.</p>
<p>Having always striven to use data and technology to maximize the impact of my work, I transitioned from a life scientist to a data scientist, and later, fell in love with the world of engineering. This blog serves to chronicle my journey and the road ahead&mdash;sharing what I've learned, my experiences, and a few side projects I'm working on.</p>
<h2>What have I done?</h2>
<p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en.html">Nielsen</a>. I received a PhD in molecular physiology and biophysics from <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton">Baylor College of Medicine</a> where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/molecular-physiology-and-biophysics/nanoparticle-therapy-for-autoimmune-disease">new</a> <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808">treatment</a> for autoimmune diseases. During grad school, I also founded and led a <a href="http://medcenterconsulting.com">501(c)(3) nonprofit organization</a> that trains scientists and doctors to become management consultants, and also provides consulting services. Previously, I worked in <a href="https://www.canon-biomedical.com">biotech</a> and <a href="http://fannininnovation.com">venture capital</a>.</p>
