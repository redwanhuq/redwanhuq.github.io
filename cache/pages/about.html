<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Redwan, and I'm an aspiring data scientist and machine learning practitioner.</p>
<p>Although a life scientist by training, I have long since held a fascination with artificial intelligence, its real-world applications and philosophical implications. After taking courses in machine learning, I fell head over heels and decided to stop being a spectator. I've since then aligned my life with the goal of pursuing a career in data science and eventually contributing to and innovating in the field of AI. I write this blog to chronicle my journey, sharing what I've learned and a few projects I'm working on&mdash;hopefully it's helpful for others also making the transition.</p>
<h2>What have I done?</h2>
<p>I recently received a PhD in molecular physiology from <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton">Baylor College of Medicine</a> where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/molecular-physiology-and-biophysics/nanoparticle-therapy-for-autoimmune-disease">new</a> <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808">treatment</a> for autoimmune diseases. During grad school, I also founded and led a <a href="http://medcenterconsulting.com">501(c)(3) nonprofit organization</a> that trains scientists and doctors to become management consultants. Previously, I worked in biomedical <a href="https://www.canon-biomedical.com">R&amp;D</a> and <a href="http://fannininnovation.com">venture capital</a>.</p>
