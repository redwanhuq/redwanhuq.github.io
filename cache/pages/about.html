<p><img src="/images/my-photo.jpg" height="250" align="left" style="padding-right:20px; padding-bottom:5px"> Hey there! My name is Redwan Huq, and I'm an aspiring data scientist.</p>
<p>I recently received my PhD from <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton">Baylor College of Medicine</a> where I developed a <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808">new treatment</a> for autoimmune diseases using carbon nanotechnology. During my spare time, I founded and led a <a href="http://medcenterconsulting.com">501(c)(3) non-profit business</a> that trains PhDs and MDs to become management consultants. While I've enjoyed working as an interdisciplinary scientist for the past 14 years, my favorite aspect has been generating meaningful insights from data to make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>I've long since held a fascination with artificial intelligence and I feel fortunate to be alive during a time when this field is maturing. I believe AI is poised to not only improve our daily lives as consumers, but also transform business strategy and usher in the next industrial revolution. After having learned about the world of data science and taking a course in machine learning at Baylor, I decided to stop being a spectator and turn my interests into a career. </p>
<p>I believe my hypothesis-driven and analytical approaches from working in academic and industry research, my business acumen and leadership skills from building a company, and my love for answering questions with data and code will facilitate this transition. I look forward to this adventure and write this blog to share what I'm learning along my journey and perhaps a few projects I'm working on.</p>
