<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Redwan and I'm an aspiring data scientist and machine learning practitioner.</p>
<h3>Why read this blog?</h3>
<p>I'm trained as a life scientist but I've long since held a fascination with artificial intelligence and answering questions with data. After taking courses in machine learning, I decided to stop being a spectator and focus on transitioning into data science. As I navigate this new adventure, I write this blog to chronicle my journey and share what I've learned&mdash;perhaps even a few projects I'm working on.</p>
<h3>What have I done?</h3>
<p>I just received a PhD in molecular physiology from Baylor College of Medicine where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/molecular-physiology-and-biophysics/nanoparticle-therapy-for-autoimmune-disease">new</a> <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808">treatment</a> for autoimmune diseases. During grad school, I also founded and led a <a href="http://medcenterconsulting.com">501(c)(3) nonprofit organization</a> that trains PhDs and MDs to become management consultants. Before that, I worked in biomedical <a href="https://www.canon-biomedical.com">R&amp;D</a> and <a href="http://fannininnovation.com">venture capital</a>. Throughout all of these endeavors, my favorite aspect has been generating meaningful insights from data to make more informed decisions.</p>
