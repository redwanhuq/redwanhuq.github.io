<p><img src="/images/profile.jpg" align="left" height="200" style="padding-right:20px; padding-bottom:5px">Hey there! My name is Redwan Huq, and I'm an aspiring data scientist and machine learning practitioner.</p>
<p>I recently received my PhD from <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/christine-beeton">Baylor College of Medicine</a> where I used carbon nanotechnology to develop a <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep33808">new treatment</a> for autoimmune diseases. During my spare time, I founded and led a <a href="http://medcenterconsulting.com">501(c)(3) non-profit business</a> that trains PhDs and MDs to become management consultants. While I've enjoyed working as an interdisciplinary scientist, my favorite aspect of research has been generating meaningful insights from data to make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>I've long since held a fascination with artificial intelligence and I feel fortunate to be alive during a time when this field is maturing. I believe AI is poised to not only improve our daily lives as consumers, but also transform business strategy and usher in the next industrial revolution. After having learned about the world of data science and taking a course in machine learning at Baylor, I decided to stop being a spectator and aim to turn my interests into a career. </p>
<p>I believe my hypothesis-driven and analytical approaches from working in academic and industry research for over 14 years, my business acumen and leadership skills from building a company, and my love for answering questions with data and code will facilitate this transition. As I navigate this new adventure, I write this blog to share what I'm learning along my journey and perhaps a few projects I'm working on.</p>
